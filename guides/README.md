Pedestal Docs
=============

Documentation for the Pedestal service libraries


## About this repository

At present, files under the [documentation](documentation) directory are deployed as [pedestal.io/documentation](http://pedestal.io/documentation).

In the future, we will provide tools to generate properly styled HTML yourself. Due to abundant interest, however, we've opted to release these files while they're still a little raw.

## Contributing
