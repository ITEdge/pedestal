# Connecting "Hello World" to Datomic

This tutorial extends the
[Hello World Service](/documentation/hello-world-service/) to use
strings retrieved from [Datomic]. We will start from the "helloworld"
service that we created in our first tutorial.

This tutorial assumes that you have Datomic running already. If not,
hop over to the
[download site](http://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html) and download
the free edition.

## Add Datomic to the Project

There are just a couple of steps to get our service hooked up to
Datomic. First, we need to add the dependency to our project.clj.

```
(defproject helloworld "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.0"]
                 [io.pedestal/pedestal.service "0.1.0"]
                 [org.slf4j/jul-to-slf4j "1.7.2"]
                 [org.slf4j/jcl-over-slf4j "1.7.2"]
                 [org.slf4j/log4j-over-slf4j "1.7.2"]
                 [com.datomic/datomic-free "0.8.3826"]]
  :profiles {:dev {:source-paths ["dev"]}}
  :resource-paths ["config"]
  :main ^{:skip-aot true} helloworld.server)
```

Run `lein deps` to fetch any jars you need.

## Write Schema and Seed Data

On Pedestal app, a suitable place to put a schema is the
resources/[your-project-name-here] directory. In this sample, the project
name is "helloworld", so place the Datomic schema file below in
`resources/helloworld/schema.edn`. The schema is also pretty simple:
it has just one attribute.

```clj
[
  {:db/id #db/id[:db.part/db]
  :db/ident :hello/color
  :db/valueType :db.type/string
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
  :db/fulltext true
  :db/doc "Today's color"
  :db.install/_attribute :db.part/db}
]
```

This application doesn't have any way to write new data into Datomic
yet. So, in order to have something to show in a browser, we'll put
some seed data into Datomic. This file can also reside under the
resources/helloworld directory. Create the file
`resources/helloworld/seed-data.edn` with the following contents.

```clj
[
{:db/id #db/id[:db.part/user -1], :hello/color "True Mint"}
{:db/id #db/id[:db.part/user -2], :hello/color "Yellowish White"}
{:db/id #db/id[:db.part/user -3], :hello/color "Orange Red"}
{:db/id #db/id[:db.part/user -4], :hello/color "Olive Green"}
]
```

The funny looking negative IDs are a way to ask Datomic to assign
entity IDs automatically.

## Create Some Data Functions

Now we need create functions to establish a connection to Datomic,
define the schema, and retrieve data.  This code is nothing new, just
a simple Datomic sample. Put the following code into
`src/helloworld/peer.clj`.

```clj
(ns helloworld.peer
  (:require [datomic.api :as d :refer (q)]))

(def uri "datomic:mem://helloworld")

(def schema-tx (read-string (slurp "resources/helloworld/schema.edn")))
(def data-tx (read-string (slurp "resources/helloworld/seed-data.edn")))

(defn init-db []
  (when (d/create-database uri)
    (let [conn (d/connect uri)]
      @(d/transact conn schema-tx)
      @(d/transact conn data-tx))))

(defn results []
  (init-db)
  (let [conn (d/connect uri)]
    (q '[:find ?c :where [?e :hello/color ?c]] (d/db conn))))

```

# Use Database Results in the Service

Next, we need to use results from the database. For this, we will add
a function to `service.clj`. This new function will use `peer.clj` to
access data.

Open up `src/helloworld/service.clj` again and modify the `ns` macro to
reference helloworld.peer:

```clj
(ns helloworld.service
    (:require [io.pedestal.http :as bootstrap]
              [io.pedestal.http.route.definition :refer [defroutes]]
              [ring.util.response :refer [response]]
              [helloworld.peer :as peer :refer [results]]))
```

Let's now rewrite the `home-page` function in `service.clj` so that we
see the output from Datomic.

```clj
(defn home-page
  [request]
  (response (str "Hello Colors! " (results))))
```

If you still have the service running from
[Hello World Service](/documentation/hello-world-service/), then you
will need to exit the REPL. Restart the service the same way as
before: `lein repl`, `(use 'dev)`, and `(start)`.

Now point your browser at
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) and you will see the
thrilling string:

```clj
Hello Colors! [["True Mint"], ["Olive Green"], ["Orange Red"], ["Yellowish White"]]
```

Because `home-page` returns a string, the HTTP response will be sent
with a content type of "text/plain", as we can see by using "curl" to
access the server.

``` bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2013 20:31:06 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 82
Server: Jetty(8.1.9.v20130131)

Hello Colors! [["True Mint"], ["Orange Red"], ["Olive Green"], ["Yellowish White"]]
```
